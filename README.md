## How to use?

Two methods:

    > **Note that this app is not registered in Google Playstore; It will prompt many security warning during installation. However, it is safe to install. If you are skeptic about that, rightly so, and you should be, use second method.**

1. Install [Expo app](https://expo.io/learn) on your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en) or [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) device. Then scan the QR code on https://expo.io/@tejastez/rules-of-rationality via Expo App. This method is safe and works on both Android and iOS.
